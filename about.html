            <p>
                I am a junior, self-taught developer with a passion for creating clean, Christian-oriented tools on the
                web.
                My focus is on <strong>.NET 8's MAUI Blazor Hybrid</strong>, where I’ve developed a fair amount of
                knowledge
                through hands-on experience and an eagerness to learn.
            </p>

            <h5 class="center-align">How It All Began</h5>
            <p>
                My father, a software engineer for as long as I can remember, introduced me to programming. His
                influence
                and my curiosity led me to develop a deep interest in coding, especially in building tools and
                applications
                that align with my Christian values.
            </p>

            <h5 class="center-align">What I’m Proud Of</h5>
            <p>
                One of my proudest achievements is this site and my work on
                <a href="https://sojourn.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sojourn.network</a>,
                a Biblical hospitality network I developed with my father. These projects represent my drive for clean and Christian, internet-based tools.
            </p>

            <h5 class="center-align">When I'm Not Coding</h5>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I spend my time with family or enjoy camping in nature.
            </p>

            <h5 class="center-align">Looking Ahead</h5>
            <p>
                As I continue to grow as a developer, my goal is to expand my skills, build my portfolio, and create
                tools that
                guide people to Christ.
            </p>

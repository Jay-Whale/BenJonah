                <h5>King's Valley</h5>
                <p>King's Valley is a very simple and easy game to play. This is because all the pieces move the same.
                    Any piece can move straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal, but always as far as possible. Pieces
                    always stop their movement either at the sides of the board or before another tile in the same row,
                    column, or diagonal.
                    The winner is the first player that manages to move his king piece to the central square of the
                    board, which represents the King's Valley.</p>

                <h5>Cephalopod</h5>
                <p>Cephalopod is a dice game that includes no chance. The dice comprise the playing pieces. The goal is
                    to fill a board of various sizes with as many of your dice as possible. This is complicated by a
                    capturing mechanic that keeps the board in constant flux. The game ends when the board has been
                    completely filled. As with most Mark Steere games, draws and ties are not possible.</p>
